    "Machine Learning (ML) is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of giving them step-by-step rules. In traditional programming, we provide the data and clearly defined instructions, and the computer produces the result. But in Machine Learning, we provide the data along with the correct answers, and the computer automatically finds the rules or patterns that connect them. This allows the system to make predictions or decisions on new data without being explicitly programmed for every situation."
